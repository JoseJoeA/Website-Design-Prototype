	<h2>Lodging Information</h2>
	<p>Taniti Island has a pool of different lodging options. We got different prices for lodging that includes an inexpensive hostel to a luxury 4-Star Resort! But if you are not looking for these options, you can also look to rent a house, beach house, or condo! All of these options are strictly regulated and inspected by the Tanitian Government, so everything will be safe and we will make sure you have a great time! If you are planning on staying with us, please continue to read for more important information about lodging and arrival. </p>

	<h2>Planning to travel? Transportation and Arrival</h2>
	<p>Traveling to Taniti is very simple, most of our visitors come by air transportation, as we have a small airport for small jets and also propeller planes. We are expanding the airport in the next few years for us to be able to get bigger jets to land in our island. Though most of our visitors come from air transportation, we also get visitors by cruise ships. Our visitors arrive in Yellow Leaf Bay, one night per week. If you plan to stay with us, please choose one of the methods of arrival below to see your options for cruise ships, air transportation, hotels, houses, or condos. If you also plan to have ground transportation (rent a car, bus, shuttle), please also look in the ground transportation section below. </p>
